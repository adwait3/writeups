we know that the password is in file data.txt and that it is followed by a lot of "=" characters. So we can find the password if we find all the strings in the file we can do this by the string command which finds and prints all the human redable sequences in a file.
now we can use the grep command to find tthe string which is after "=" characters. i use 4 as:
- strings data.txt | grep ====
which gives us a list of strings which are followed by 4 = characters or more among which is our password:
