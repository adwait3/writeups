Logged out of bandit0 with exit
Relogged into bandit1 using ssh the same way, but changed the user to bandit1 and pasted the
password in(NH2SXQwcBdpmTEzi3bvBHMM9H66vVXjL) when prompted.
Listed the files inside using ls 
Used cat - but it wasn’t executing and kept blanking on to the next line.
Then I reached
[this](https://www.cs.ait.ac.th/~on/O/oreilly/unix/upt/ch23_14.htm#:~:text=That's%20a%20perfectly%2
0legal%20filename,to%20type%20a%20command%20option).
From the google search for dashed filenames in overthewire’s helpful reading material thing.
and realised that u need to use’ ./ ‘ in front of filenames starting with ‘ - ‘ because
otherwise linux sees the thing ur typing in as a command. ( many linux commands start with ‘ - ‘
as i later came across them, like the -p for port that u use on ssh )
Then used cat and got the password
