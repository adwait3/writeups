# level 13-14
## goal
in this level the password was in a file /etc/bandit_pass/bandit14 but it could only be accessed by the user with username bandit14 so we could only read it when logged into next level so instead we we were given with a private ssh key with which we can access the next level
## solution
private key is just like a password where only users with the key are allowed to access certain things , we can use -i  in ssh with the file name while loggign in to the bandit server as: 
ssh -i sshkey.private bandit14@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
which gives us the access to the next level as we have the key.

now we can read the file /etc/bandit_pass/bandit14  as bandit14 and get the password
