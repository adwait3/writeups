# level 4-5
read the overwire tip
It says the file is the only human readable one, and they had a tip on in case ur terminal messed
up. Figured the file i need would be a text and had to watch out for binary files. Sure enough,
when I logged in and ls cd’d I saw these inthere :
I figured cat’ing each file would be stressful, so I looked up linux command to check filetype.
Then used file to check each one’s filetype and found that file7 is not binary Cat’d 007 and got
the password. lrIWWI6bB37kxfiCQZqUdOIYfr6eEeqR
