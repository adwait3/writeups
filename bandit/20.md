# level 19 - 20
## goal
in this level we had to use setuid and find the password which was stored in /etc/bandit_pass, this was related to the permissions and only the user bandit20 had the access to read the file.
## solution
first we use the list command with -l flag which gives us additional information such as permissions now we know that we can access the password by running the commands as user bandit 20so i use ./bandit20-do to run commands as bandit 20 through which i cat the bandit 20 file /etc/bandit_pass by running the command 
* ./bandit20-do cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit20
