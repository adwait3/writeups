# level 20- 21
## goal
in this question we had to set up a port on the localhost with any address we want so that the setuid binary file can connect to our localhost through that port and read the passsword for the current level and if it matches give us the password for the next level.

## solution 
to set up a port on our localhost i opened another terminal window and used the netcat command with flag -lvp where
* l = listen
* v = verboss (it gives output)
* p = port
and our desired address to port i used 6969
this sets up our localhost on the port to which we can talk via connection through the port.
now we go back to the other terminal window and run the program suconnect again with our port adress that we just set up(
6969)

  this connects it with our local host now we can submit our current password via the other window and we get the output whicch is the next password , in the previous window we can see what the program read and what was the output.
