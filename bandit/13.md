# level 12-13
## goal
the goal of this level was to get the password from a file data.txt which has been compressed repeteadly by different methods (gzip,bzip2 and tar)
## solution
first i made a directory under tmp called "a" using mkdir /tmp/a as instructed in the question and copied the compressed file there using cp so that i can change it's name using mv and decompress it as follows

I used the file command to check its type to know what command i need to use to decompress it
