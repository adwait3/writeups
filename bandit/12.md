# level 11-12
we know that the password is in data.txt ehich has all lowercase and uppercase letters rotated by 13 positions that is the ROT13 encryption. So we can find the value by decrypting the file we can do this by the tr command which is used to translate the characters, i searched the equivalent for ROT13 decryption and found the command:
-cat data.txt | tr a-zA-Z n-za-mN-ZA-M  
which gave us the password:
